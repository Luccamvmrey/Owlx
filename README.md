# Owlx
Owlx application for Android Development Classes. 2023.1

The idea was to create a sales application similar to OLX.
The project requires our app to have access to geolocation, and we have decided to use it to share the user's location and show them the closest sellers.

As of 26/04/2023 we have implemented:

- Splash Page, which will contain our logo:

- Login Page, where we still have to implement user validation:
